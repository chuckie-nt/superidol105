          Streaming has been known throughout the world even before the pandemic starts, even if you started watching this type of thing before even the pandemic started or you only have caught up to this only recently we can both agree that streaming has left a big impact on our daily lives. We enjoy watching live streams even though at first we were just watching random stuff online but eventually we had settled down on a certain community online. When we were reading through the task that was handed to us we were certain about the topic we were going to research, do and talk about because even before we have been watching streams. One of the best things about streaming is that it can be easily understood by almost anyone, and from what we have experienced it was worth it. Streaming is accessible to everyone if you have a good enough internet connection and a phone. This is a media that has been around for a long time and seeing it flourish through the years makes us happy because now more people can experience the things that we went through and we are excited about how it will further evolve in the future.
